GREETINGS PEASANTS
Sorry I've just taken to opening with that recently.
Uhhhhhhhhhhhh if you crash your ship you have to press start game twice, and I have no idea how to fix it. Pretty sure it's because the thread doesn't run in the same timeline or with the same frame order as the main thing.
Also I didn't manage to add in enemies. Didn't think I would and mentioned that in the proposal - well they're half there, with functionality for attacking, hitboxes, and visuals, there are just no enemies.
Also if you have trouble finding valhalla you can turn down the 'endDistance' variable in Game.java
Oh and if you go really really really really far then the noise algorithm breaks and you see some pretty weird stuff
Enjoy
